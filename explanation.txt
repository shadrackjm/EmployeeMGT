Employee Management System (With Task Management)
_________________________________________________

Template used - NiceAdmin
_________________________

Today we are going to see How admin can:
 -  Edit and delete managers.
 -  Show logged in user profile details.
 
Let's get started..

before going to today's task ..

I will refine some of the areas of the last video:-

- Add relationship between user's and manager's tables...

This makes sense now as when you'll update or delete manager for now the users
table will not be updated or either delete the data..

so to achieve this follow along to make a relationship between the two tables..


that's it for refinement in controller  now migrate fresh to reflect the changes we made 

now we will need to register the admin again..

.







now we need to edit our managers details

i already did this in my previous video of Laravel 10 ajax crud.. if you missed it check the link in the description

or just click the card on your top right hand...

so i'll do a quick recap of what is done to edit manager's details

so now we have an edit form in good way let's check edit functionality in controller

so don't forget to do those changes in jquery functions, else validations will not work..

now edit manager

Hurray...

also edit works fine..

now show the profile details of a logged in user...

- to achieve this we need a way to retrieve user's details in login action and display them in their home pages...

update the links on sidebar for home page in admin's layout

for admin we just need to show the name and status only in profile

now to show the name of logged_in user in the top bar we will use the Auth helper functions
this will be done on each user's layouts

that's it for today's video 

on next video we will check how manager can 
- crud operation on employees
- also each user should be able to update their profiles..

so thank you friends....
