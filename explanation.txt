Employee Management System (With Task Management)
_________________________________________________

Template used - NiceAdmin
_________________________

Today we are going to see How manager can:

- crud operation on employees (CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE employees)

- before going direct to the task..

we need to add few database models and migrations for:-
- countries
- states
- cities

- I have their seeders also and i'll provide them in my project assets Directory

just follow the link in the description to get all project source codes..

now start by creating models with migrations..

then, i'll show you how to use the seeders to get all data into our database tables..

now create the seeders using the following command

then, we need to copy the data from the seeders to our new created seeders

then, we need to edit our countries migration to have fields similar with those from the seeder

so we have 4 fields:-

before run migration command edit each migration to have same fields as we did for 
countries table migration

now finish up with the cities table

now migrate your three tables..

then, we have to run the seeding command to seed all data to db..

now seed cities..

now we have all tables with data..

then we are going to continue with crud for our employees..

since we did it in last video i'll just skip the video and show you how to use the 
three tables we added in employee registration and update/edit..

- now i'll show you all changes i've made to make employee CRUD be perfect
so follow along..

first in registration

now to add employee 

yes, that's all about dependent dynamic dropdowns... 
if you find them confusing check the video link in the description i have a video discussing the issue..

so that's how we register employee..

now you can delete and edit our employee..

on delete there is no difference as for the last video..

now on edit there is a little changes that are of much importance to note.....

so here is what i did..

so that's it for edit feature..
