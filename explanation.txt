Template used - NiceAdmin

Today we are going to see how:

- add department to our Employees

since now our Employees are successfully added, they should also be categorized by 
their departments..

so to add department to Employees we need to create a department table..

so let's create a model and the migration..

but now we need to add the department to each employee... so since the employee 
table already exist we need to modify the migration and re migrate it again..

now create it again..

now let's try to migrate the two tables..

great! now we have the department table.. so let the admin add the departments..

so we will perform all the neccessary crud on departments..

as follows...

now let's try to add our first department..

sorry for that i was editing the wrong file..

now let's go to edit and delete departments..

now edit department..

now all CRUD on department is clear..

now we need to make every employee registered will have their departments..

now let's edit our employee Management module..

now let's add the department in all employee cruds..

now add department in edit also..

so from the error that we are getting i realized that i made a mistake when
creating the employee to department relationship in migration file..

thus we need to re migrate the table ..

now test it again...

now finish with when employee log in to see their department in their dashboard..

so that's it friends..
